# Advanced Stock Portfolio Analysis

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook provides an advanced toolkit for stock portfolio analysis using real-time data from Yahoo Finance. It is designed to assist in the in-depth analysis of stock portfolios by employing a range of Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly, and yfinance.

## Features
- **Data Fetching**: Downloads historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance.
- **Risk and Performance Metrics**: Calculates Sharpe Ratio, Beta against S&P 500, and Value at Risk to assess the risk and performance of the portfolio.
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Uses Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to find the optimal portfolio allocation.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Includes interactive plots of stock prices and returns over time, providing a dynamic way to analyze data using Plotly.

## Usage
To use this notebook:
1. Ensure you have the required libraries installed: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly, and yfinance.
2. Run the notebook cells sequentially to fetch data, perform calculations, and view interactive visualizations.

## Output
The notebook outputs include charts and data tables that provide insights into the stock performance and risk metrics, as well as the results from the portfolio optimization process.

### Note
This README assumes that all the required libraries are installed and that the notebook is run in an environment where external data can be fetched.
